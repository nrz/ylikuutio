# Avaruus

Avaruus is a simulation of various physical phenomena.

The following physical phenomena are or will be supported:
1. n-body Newtonian gravity simulation (implemented in Fortran, TODO: port to C++)
2. n-body Coulomb force simulation (TODO).

More simulations, including black holes and wormholes, will be implemented later.
